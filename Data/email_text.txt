Subject: PHYS 1CL: sig figs and general expectations of lab

Welcome to 1CL everybody,

This email is intended for Tues 1pm, Wed 4pm and Thur 
1pm.  If you are not in any of these sections, plese let me know, so I don't 
spam you the whole quarter.

Here are a few expectations and policies and other stuff that will be useful for 
my lab.

Expectations on the conclusions:
================================

conclusions should be:
---------------------
**short and to the point.  Only answer what is asked of you on the prompt.
**neat and organized.  
  This means:
  --tables and bullet points where appropriate.  
  --graphs and tables should be clearly labeled
  --final results of calculations should be boxed or highlighted
  --show work in a neat step-by-step format
**clear.  Be specific in what you are talking about.  
  For example, if you say 'human error' was a source of error, then tell me 
  exactly what the 'human error' was.

Be sure to include everything:
------------------------------
**every directly measured number should have an uncertainty attached to it.
  --write the uncertainty and the value you want to report in the same place, 
    not in different parts fo the lab.
  --please write like blah +/- blah.  
**please include units everywhere where appropriate.
**check to make sure that you have addressed everything in the conclusion prompt

error/uncertainty:
--------------------
There is a very good discussion of error and uncertainty in the beginning of 
the lab.  read it.


Significant figures and error:
==============================
Please try to remember to report youruncertainty and the relevant values with 
the correct amount of sigfigs. These rules are not officially part of 1CL 
requirements, but I have chosen to require this for my sections because 
reporting data in a consistent way is important.

The rules:
**keep 2 significant digits of the uncertainty if it starts with a '1' and 
  only 1 significant digit if it starts with '2' through '9'

**report your numbers to the same number of decimal places as the uncertainty.

lets do a few examples:
----------------------------------------

546.234 +/- 0.156    -->  546.23+/-0.16

546.234 +/- 26.754   -->  550+/-30

5.02542+/- 0.9782    -->   5.0 +/- 1.0

0.0012  +/- 0.233554 -->  0.0+/-0.2

(notice in the last one, the uncertainty was actually bigger than the
reported value.  This means the numbers is consistent with zero)

Why do we even bother?
------------------------------------------
Keeping track of these sigfigs are a way of making sure we don't report 
something that we can't claim to know.  Remember that uncertainty is only an 
estimate, so putting too many decimals would be misleading.  This is why these
conventions are in place.

While the rules I state here are pretty widely observed in science as a whole,
your Chem TA or another physics TAs might have different conventions or maybe 
doesn't even care at all.  I do.  This will mean points off for not following 
this (likely only a fraction of a point).

Grading issues?:
=================
if you notice in issue with grading, such as I messed up and you think you are 
right and I am wrong, or the grade I gave on your assignment is different from 
what is posted online, talk to me ASAP.
n
The best way of doing this is to bring the assignment to lab and ask me before 
or after class.  If you simply feel you deserve more credit, take consolation in
the fact that I grade everyone the same way so I'm being as fair as I can be.

You have two weeks from when the assignment is handed back to you to do this, so 
please look over your work as soon as you can.  After two weeks, I will no 
longer make any changes. 

Need help physics help?
========================
LTAC office hourse are listed on the TED website.  I myself do not have office 
hours, but will try to answer emails promptly.  For more general physics 
questions, there is the physics tutorial center (http://tutorialcenter.ucsd.edu)
but please bear in mind, the tutors in general are not expected to know the 
details of 1CL lab requirements and are often answering your questions cold, 
with no preparation so take what they say with a grain of salt.

Your TA,
Scott
